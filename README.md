## Directions:

Use the data below to build the component below with React:

```javascript
const cards = [
  {
    tagline: "Rent a NYC apartment",
    description: "Shop the city's most comprehensive listings, filtering for the features you want most.",
    buttonText: "SEARCH RENTALS",
  },
  {
    tagline: "Buy with confidence",
    description: "Find your NYC dream home and match with an Expert Agent who can help you navigate the buying process.",
    buttonText: "SEARCH SALES",
  },
  {
    tagline: "Sell your home successfully",

## Keep in mind...
- Start with the shell of the component using placeholder texts, then include the data.
- What is the hierarchy of components? (Which component is the parent and which is the child?)
- How can I keep my code DRY?
- How can I segment this component to be reusable?


**Do not worry about the underlined text in the screenshot**
